The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of viscous, incompressible fluids and 
form the cornerstone of fluid dynamics. They model diverse phenomena such as airflow, 
ocean currents, and blood circulation. Despite their seemingly simple appearance, these 
equations pose deep mathematical challenges in three dimensions. The central open 
question is whether smooth, globally defined solutions always exist or whether 
singularities-points where velocity or pressure become infinite can develop in 
finite time.

The problem of proving the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions in 
three dimensions is one of the seven Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize 
Problems. Solving it would significantly advance our understanding of turbulence and 
the mathematical structure of fluid motion.
